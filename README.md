# urlshortener
So I made a url shortener. Should work pretty well.

Enpoints:

/geturl/{name}-redirects you to the saved url with the name you provide, if it exists

/seturl/{name}:{sitename}:{tld}-creates a new url shortening. sitename is without www. or https://, tld is like .com or .net, name can be anything as long as its not taken
